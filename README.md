The extension also allows you to easily categorize and organize your notes using tags. To add a tag, simply type it into the tag field at the bottom of the note.

You can use **bold**, *italic*, or `code` formatting in your notes using Markdown syntax. For example:

- To make text **bold**, surround it with double asterisks: `**bold**`
- To make text *italic*, surround it with single asterisks: `*italic*`
- To format text as `code`, surround it with backticks: `` `code` ``
